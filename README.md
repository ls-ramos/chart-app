# Evolua Chart

An Android application designed to enhance focus and concentration through neurolinguistic exercises. This app was my second published mobile application, developed to help students improve their study sessions through brain stimulation techniques.

## Overview

Evolua Chart guides users through a series of cognitive exercises that combine:
- Visual letter recognition
- Vocal pronunciation
- Physical movements
- Coordination tasks

These combined activities help activate multiple brain regions simultaneously, potentially improving focus for subsequent tasks like studying.

## Features

- **Interactive Exercise Interface**: Large, clear letters with secondary movement prompts
- **Customizable Settings**: 
  - Adjustable letter display speed
  - Configurable exercise duration
  - Multiple difficulty levels
- **Tutorial System**: Built-in guidance for new users
- **Progress Tracking**: Exercise completion monitoring
- **Offline Support**: No internet connection required

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: Android Native
- **Language**: Java
- **Min SDK**: 16 (Android 4.1)
- **Target SDK**: 27 (Android 8.1)
- **Architecture**: Fragment-based UI with shared preferences for data persistence

## Development Context

This application was developed early in my programming career as my second published Android app. While functional and published to the Google Play Store, it serves as a milestone in my development journey and demonstrates several areas for potential improvement:

### Areas for Enhancement

1. **Architecture & Design**
   - Implement MVVM or Clean Architecture patterns
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Dependency injection

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for business logic
   - Implement UI tests
   - Add integration tests

3. **Modern Android Practices**
   - Migrate to Kotlin
   - Implement Jetpack Compose for UI
   - Use Coroutines for asynchronous operations
   - Implement ViewModel and LiveData

4. **User Experience**
   - Better UI/UX
   - Improved accessibility features
   - Enhanced exercise customization
