# Chart neurolinguistico app

Let's get more focused !!
The ideia of this app is basically stimulate many parts of your brain so ou can have a better focus in the next activity you will perform. You can find more about this tecnique here: http://download.golfinho.com.br/downloads/chart.pdf

## Goal
This tecnique was taught during my studies to the college-specific entrance exam. This app was developed so others students could use it to enhance their studies as well.

## What would i do if i had more time with this project
This project was developed when I was entering the world of programming and it has no testing, and it doesn't have the best usability. If I had more time on this project I would structure the classes better, that is, I would break the system into small parts, add tests to each part of the program and rethink the look and usability of the application based on feedback I received, because in some aspects the app is not more convenient than a paper printed with the same exercise that you can place anywhere on the wall.
